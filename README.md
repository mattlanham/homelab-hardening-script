# Basic Hardening Script

I've been setting up a bunch of virtual machines for my homelab project, and having to run
a bunch of manual commands was getting tedioud.

So I've thrown together this quick script that I intend to iterate.

## Usage

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattlanham/homelab-hardening-script/refs/heads/main/kubernetes/ubuntu.sh
chmod +x ubuntu.sh
sudo ./ubuntu.sh
```
